SITE SKELETON (optimized media ready)

- Keep all .html and style.css in the same folder (site root).
- Live site points to `Web_Gal_Box_optimized/` (lightweight images/videos).
- Originals stay in `Web_Gal_Box/` as backup; leave it untracked if you publish.
- Add new media into `Web_Gal_Box/…` and re-run the optimize step to refresh `Web_Gal_Box_optimized/`.

Folder names are case/space/apostrophe sensitive. Match exactly.

Test: open index.html, then click portfolio tiles.
