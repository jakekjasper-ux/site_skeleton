 <div class="prose">
 <p>I worked in a well pump shop where the same people were responsible for building systems correctly, installing them under real constraints, and servicing them when they aged — across municipal, commercial, and private work.</p>

 <p>At Gady Pump &amp; Electric, the shop operated under DOH-regulated water system requirements and maintained a UL-508 certified panel shop. Phil Gady was a Class IV Water System Operator, and the shop acted as operator and manager of record for approximately ten Class A and B systems, including small communities, churches, and schools. That responsibility meant immediate action when systems alarmed, failed, or drifted out of compliance.</p>

 <p>During my time there, Phil and I were the only licensed workers. I worked as a UL panel shop technician while earning my 03A electrical license, building and servicing controls that had to pass inspection, survive long duty cycles, and remain serviceable years later — because we were the ones called when they didn’t.</p>

 <p>The systems shown here include municipal pump stations, reservoirs, school systems, PUD infrastructure, and private installations built to the same operational standards.</p>

 <h2>Residential Panels (UL 508 Shop Standards)</h2>
 <p class="section-subtitle">These controls were designed and built in-house to UL-508 style standards, with the expectation that we would be responsible for them long after installation.</p>
