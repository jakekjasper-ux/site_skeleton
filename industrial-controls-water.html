 <div class="prose">
  <p>My work in water systems was performed through <strong>Gady Pump &amp; Electric</strong>, operating under a <strong>Washington State Water Works Manager Class IV</strong> within <strong>DOH-regulated public water systems</strong>. In practice, this work was executed by a <strong>two-person operation</strong> - Phil Gady and myself - with <strong>clearly defined scopes of responsibility and accountability</strong>.</p>

  <p>I hold a <strong>Washington State 03A Domestic Pump Electrician license</strong> and accumulated <strong>documented hours</strong> toward additional electrical and water system certifications while working under <strong>licensed supervision</strong>. Field work included <strong>residential, commercial, and public water systems</strong> such as <strong>municipal and community wells</strong>, <strong>pump stations</strong>, <strong>reservoirs</strong>, <strong>booster systems</strong>, and associated <strong>electrical and control infrastructure</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Gady Pump &amp; Electric</strong> was entrusted by <strong>Stevens County PUD</strong> as its <strong>contractor for well and control work</strong>. During my time there, I executed the majority of <strong>on-site electrical, controls, and service operations</strong> within my <strong>licensed scope</strong>. For tasks outside the 03A scope - including <strong>incoming three-phase utility service work</strong> or actions requiring <strong>Water Works Manager authority</strong> - Phil was present as required. For work <strong>delegable under operator standards</strong>, I <strong>operated independently</strong>, with final responsibility retained by the <strong>operator of record</strong>.</p>

  <p>The systems shown here include <strong>UL-508 industrial control panels</strong>, <strong>VFD-driven three-phase pump controls</strong>, and <strong>telemetry / SCADA-linked installations</strong> serving <strong>schools</strong>, <strong>small community water systems</strong>, <strong>HOAs</strong>, and <strong>PUD-served infrastructure</strong>. My role as a <strong>UL-508 panel technician</strong> allowed a broader technical scope than a standard electrical trainee or specialty license alone, particularly in <strong>control logic</strong>, <strong>panel diagnostics</strong>, and <strong>in-place modifications</strong> performed under <strong>UL-508 shop practices</strong>.</p>

  <p>Much of the work occurred on <strong>active systems</strong>, with <strong>limited shutdown tolerance</strong> and <strong>public-health constraints</strong>. I worked alongside <strong>Class IV operators</strong> within systems requiring <strong>formal coordination</strong> for <strong>chlorination</strong>, <strong>post-work sampling</strong>, and <strong>return-to-service verification</strong> following maintenance or repair.</p>

  <p>Responsibilities included <strong>live electrical and control diagnostics</strong>, <strong>VFD installation and troubleshooting</strong>, <strong>confined-space pump vault access</strong>, <strong>hoist-assisted pump pulls</strong> using <strong>Hunke 10-ton</strong> and <strong>Pulstar 12-ton</strong> rigs (with breakout tooling and <strong>wireless remote controls</strong>), <strong>control panel inspection and modification</strong>, and <strong>coordination with operators, utilities, and inspectors</strong>.</p>

  <p>I routinely handled <strong>sample collection</strong>, supported <strong>chemical feed and blend-rate systems</strong> tied to <strong>flow and contact-time requirements</strong>, and responded to <strong>emergency alerts</strong> on monitored systems. Several of the systems serviced required <strong>rapid response</strong> to restore water service or stabilize operation while maintaining <strong>regulatory compliance</strong> throughout the repair.</p>

  <p>In public water infrastructure, <strong>controls are operational infrastructure</strong>. <strong>Panel layout</strong>, <strong>conductor routing</strong>, <strong>labeling</strong>, <strong>alarm clarity</strong>, and <strong>service access</strong> directly affect safety, response time, and regulatory compliance. Systems that cannot be diagnosed under real field conditions are unsafe, regardless of schematic intent.</p>

  <p>The objective of my work was stable operation and systems operators could understand, trust, and maintain, with clear boundaries between electrical responsibility, operator authority, and regulatory oversight. Despite formal licensing limits, I was routinely trusted with <strong>independent judgment</strong> on <strong>system diagnostics</strong>, <strong>corrective actions</strong>, and <strong>emergency response decisions</strong>.</p>
