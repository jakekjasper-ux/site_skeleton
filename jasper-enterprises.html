 <p class="lead">
 Jasper Enterprises was a multi-state lodgepole post-and-rail and agricultural operation spanning Washington,
 Idaho, Montana, British Columbia, and California. Working inside that environment meant early exposure to
 industrial systems as they really run: dirty, loud, throughput-driven, and full of tradeoffs.
 </p>

 <div class="prose">
 <p>
 The point of this case study isn't that I've been around mills. It's that I learned how real operations
 behave: how log yards feed production, how stations constrain throughput, and how every decision creates
 downstream byproducts, maintenance, and logistics.
 </p>

 <ul>
 <li>Log-yard handling and staging (sorting, feeding, and flow control into processing lines)</li>
 <li>Line-based manufacturing stations (transfer, guarding, tooling, fixtures, and repeatability)</li>
 <li>Waste-stream realities (byproduct accumulation, secondary processing, and site-level logistics)</li>
 <li>Facility-scale systems thinking (layout, circulation, and material movement across the site)</li>
 </ul>

 <p>
 Later, stepping into leadership during a period of operational instability gave me a two-sided view:
 technical field reality on one side, and organizational decision-making on the other.

 This isn't cleanup footage. It's stockpiled production byproduct from continuous mill operations.
 A ~30-foot pile of cutoffs makes the point better than any spreadsheet: scale creates constraints,
 and constraints force systems thinking.
