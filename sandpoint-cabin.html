 <p class="lead">Sandpoint, ID | 1960 A-Frame Log Cabin | May–Present (Work Halted Mid-Process)</p>

 <div class="prose">
 <p>This project documents structural and systems work on a 1960 A-frame log cabin originally built for seasonal use, not year-round occupancy.</p>

 <p>The planned remodel included two bathrooms and a kitchen, requiring significant structural stabilization and major plumbing and electrical upgrades to support modern fixtures, appliances, and loads. Work progressed through investigation, correction, and partial rebuild phases before being halted prior to finish completion. The photos on this page show the actual condition reached before access to the site was terminated.</p>
 </div>
 </section>

 <section class="section">
 <h3>Existing Conditions and Structural Exposure</h3>
 <div class="prose">
 <p>Initial work focused on exposing the true condition of the structure. Photos show selective demolition used to uncover damaged subfloor sections, compromised framing, and irregular assemblies created by past modifications. These conditions could not reliably support new tile, plumbing fixtures, or mechanical systems without correction. Structural exposure was deliberate and targeted. Assemblies were opened only far enough to verify load paths, bearing conditions, and interfaces before committing to rebuild decisions.</p>

 <h3>Systems Planning Across Floors</h3>
 <div class="prose">
 <p>The remodel required coordinated plumbing and electrical upgrades across multiple levels. Planned changes included heated floors, a dishwasher, garbage disposal, additional ventilation, and relocation of the water heater to a different floor and room. These upgrades affected penetrations, routing, access, and sequencing throughout the structure. Photos show staged exposure and planning so systems could be routed intentionally, rather than patched into legacy conditions that were never designed to support them.</p>
 </div>
</section>

<section class="section">
 <h3>Structural Correction and Preparation</h3>
 <div class="prose">
 <p>Once exposed, framing and subfloor assemblies were corrected and stabilized where movement, degradation, or misalignment was identified. Photos in this section show framing brought back into plane and prepared to support future systems and finishes without relying on finish materials to compensate for structural error. No finish work was advanced until the underlying structure was made sound.</p>
 </div>
</section>

<section class="section">
 <h3>Electrical and Mechanical Integration (In Progress)</h3>
 <div class="prose">
 <p>Electrical and mechanical work was coordinated alongside structural phases. Photos reflect lighting layout, power routing, ventilation planning, and bathroom electrical coordination necessary to support the planned upgrades. Final trim-out, appliance connections, and commissioning were not completed.</p>
 </div>
</section>

<section class="section">
 <h3>Upper Bathroom - Structural and Shower Work (Partial)</h3>
 <div class="prose">
 <p>The upper bathroom required rebuilding a missing or failed shower assembly within a structure not designed for tight tolerances. Photos show framing correction, shower construction, and early finish planning. Surrounding wall assemblies remained open, with Tyvek visible, pending final enclosure and finish installation that was not reached prior to project stoppage.</p>

 <h3>Lower Bathroom - Slab-on-Grade (Partial Rebuild)</h3>
 <div class="prose">
 <p>The lower bathroom was taken down close to structure. Work sequencing was tied to the upper bath and kitchen: upstairs plumbing and electrical had to be finalized above, and kitchen electrical/plumbing reworked behind the shower wall, before fully removing the lower shower and rebuilding. Images show the legacy unit held in place while upstream systems were resolved, followed by slab exposure, bracing, and layout correction prior to waterproofing. Drainage location and clearances were addressed early, recognizing that slab conditions allow little adjustment once assemblies are closed.</p>

 <h3>Working Conditions and Interruption</h3>
 <div class="prose">
 <p>The cabin is located more than 20 minutes outside Sandpoint and over two hours from the primary shop. Portions of the work were performed while living onsite during active demolition and system changeovers, including periods without running water. As new conditions were uncovered, walkthroughs were repeatedly requested to review findings and confirm how the owner wished to proceed. Access to the project was ultimately terminated before completion. The condition shown on this page represents the maximum extent of work completed.</p>
 </div>
</section>

<section class="section">
 <h3>Finish Carpentry - Planned but Not Reached</h3>
 <div class="prose">
 <p>Finish carpentry, including cedar tongue-and-groove ceilings and upper wall sections, was part of the planned scope but was not installed in unfinished areas at the time work stopped. Photos showing exposed Tyvek reflect the project state when access was terminated, before final enclosure and finish sequencing could occur.</p>
 </div>
</section>
<section class="section">
 <h3>Closing</h3>
 <p>This project reflects the same approach used in infrastructure and systems work: identify failure modes early, correct them before closing assemblies, and rebuild in a way that remains serviceable, stable, and predictable over time.</p>
