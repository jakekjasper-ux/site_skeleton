 <div class="prose">
<p>I was originally hired to build a cabinet to infill a void and to repair finish damage left by the prior removal of a fireplace/chimney and a dividing wall between the kitchen and living room.</p>

<p>During inspection and preparation for that work, it became clear that the scope could not remain cosmetic. The removed fireplace had been functioning as a primary structural support, and its absence fundamentally changed how loads were being carried through the house.</p>

<h3>Original Load Path and Its Removal</h3>
<p>The original fireplace and chimney assembly had been carrying vertical load at a central location in the structure. After its removal, that load path was never properly replaced. Instead, posts and blocking were added below, creating a condition where loads were redistributed informally rather than transferred through a designed structural system. This change was concealed by finishes and was not apparent until the space was opened.</p>

<h3>Stairway Retrofit and Joist Interruption</h3>
<p>Further inspection revealed that the stairway adjacent to this area was a retrofit, not part of the original structure. To install the stairs, floor joists had been cut without proper headers, supports, or tie-ins. The interrupted joists were never reconnected into a continuous load-bearing system. As a result, portions of the kitchen floor, stair landing, and adjacent living space were effectively suspended, relying on blocking and posts rather than being supported from below.</p>

<h3>Structural Implications</h3>
<p>Under these conditions, the issue was not material degradation but missing load paths. Cosmetic repair would not have addressed the underlying problem. Any cabinetry, flooring, or trim installed without correcting structural support would have been carrying load unintentionally and masking an unsafe condition. Identifying this early prevented finish work from being installed over a system that could not perform as intended.</p>

<h3>Cabinet Work in Context</h3>
<p>The cabinet work was approached with an understanding that finish elements must not be asked to compensate for structural deficiencies. Photos show cabinet construction and integration aligned with the corrected understanding of how the space needed to function structurally, rather than assuming the original support conditions still existed. Finish work was treated as dependent on structure, not a substitute for it.</p>
</div>

 <h3>Diagnostic findings</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>Fireplace/chimney removal left a structural void without a restored load path</li>
 <li>Stair relocation cut framing without proper load redistribution</li>
 <li>Joists past the stair opening lacked ledger support and continuous bearing</li>
 <li>HVAC return duct was carrying unintended structural load</li>
 <li>Kitchen floor slope was a symptom, not the root problem</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Corrective approach</h3>
<p>
The solution required a slow, methodical process rather than demolition. Loads were incrementally relieved,
reintroduced, and redistributed through a staged sequence of temporary bracing, controlled jacking, and
permanent structural correction.
</p>

 <p>Work progressed in cycles:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Install temporary supports</li>
 <li>Jack in small increments to avoid finish damage</li>
 <li>Lock gains with permanent framing</li>
<li>Re-evaluate load behavior</li>
<li>Repeat until the floor plane stabilized</li>
</ul>

 <h3>Kitchen integration</h3>
 <p>
 Once the underlying structure was corrected, finish work could proceed without masking unresolved movement.
 The kitchen ceiling and soffit were selectively opened and repaired to align with the corrected framing below.
 </p>

 <p>
 A custom-built pantry cabinet was fabricated off-site and installed to integrate cleanly into the existing
 galley layout, allowing the finished space to read intentional rather than compromised by the structural work
 that made it possible.

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>
The finished kitchen reflects the corrected structure beneath it: stabilized framing, improved serviceability,
and a coherent load path where one had been missing for years. This project demonstrates a systems-first
approach: treating visible finishes as the final step of structural problem-solving, not a substitute for it.
