 <div class="prose">
 <p>
 A masonry fireplace and chimney had been removed by the current owner, leaving behind a vertical void
 that was braced without restoring a proper load path.
 </p>

 <p>
 At some point in the more distant past, likely in the 1980s, the basement stairs were relocated to their
 current position. That change cut directly into the floor framing and was never properly tied back into
 the structure, further interrupting floor support. The affected joists were never adequately connected
 to a ledger nor properly transferred to bearing elements.
 </p>

<p>
As shown in the basement photos, the unsupported section of floor had effectively been hanging on minimal
blocking between misaligned members, with a return-air duct unintentionally carrying structural load.
The result was progressive sagging that telegraphed directly into the kitchen floor above.

 <h3>Diagnostic findings</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>Fireplace/chimney removal left a structural void without a restored load path</li>
 <li>Stair relocation cut framing without proper load redistribution</li>
 <li>Joists past the stair opening lacked ledger support and continuous bearing</li>
 <li>HVAC return duct was carrying unintended structural load</li>
 <li>Kitchen floor slope was a symptom, not the root problem</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Corrective approach</h3>
<p>
The solution required a slow, methodical process rather than demolition. Loads were incrementally relieved,
reintroduced, and redistributed through a staged sequence of temporary bracing, controlled jacking, and
permanent structural correction.
</p>

 <p>Work progressed in cycles:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Install temporary supports</li>
 <li>Jack in small increments to avoid finish damage</li>
 <li>Lock gains with permanent framing</li>
<li>Re-evaluate load behavior</li>
<li>Repeat until the floor plane stabilized</li>
</ul>

 <h3>Kitchen integration</h3>
 <p>
 Once the underlying structure was corrected, finish work could proceed without masking unresolved movement.
 The kitchen ceiling and soffit were selectively opened and repaired to align with the corrected framing below.
 </p>

 <p>
 A custom-built pantry cabinet was fabricated off-site and installed to integrate cleanly into the existing
 galley layout, allowing the finished space to read intentional rather than compromised by the structural work
 that made it possible.

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>
The finished kitchen reflects the corrected structure beneath it: stabilized framing, improved serviceability,
and a coherent load path where one had been missing for years. This project demonstrates a systems-first
approach: treating visible finishes as the final step of structural problem-solving, not a substitute for it.
