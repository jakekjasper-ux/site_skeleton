 <p class="lead">My work in FIRST Robotics was my introduction to real systems engineering: designing, building, integrating, and maintaining complex machines under hard constraints of time, budget, and reliability.</p>
 <p>Robots were not evaluated only on performance. They were evaluated on whether they could be understood, repaired, and redeployed quickly after failure. That reality shaped how I approached every design decision.</p>
 </section>

 <section class="section">
 <h2>Systems Integration, Not Isolated Mechanisms</h2>
 <p>The robots I worked on were full systems: drivetrain, intake, conveyor, manipulation, wiring, controls, and software all had to coexist within strict size, weight, and time limits.</p>
 <p>My focus was on integration, not isolated subsystems. That meant:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Packaging mechanisms so they did not interfere with wiring or service access</li>
 <li>Designing layouts that made motion, power flow, and failure points visually obvious</li>
 <li>Avoiding unnecessary complexity that would be difficult to diagnose in competition</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Designs were judged not by elegance on paper, but by whether they worked reliably in real matches and could be repaired in minutes in the pit.</p>

 <h2>Functional 3D Printing in the Drivetrain</h2>
 <p>One of the most critical components I worked on was a 3D-printed conveyor / track drive gear used in the robot's tracked intake system.</p>
 <p>This gear was not cosmetic or secondary — it directly transmitted motor torque to the tracks. If it failed, the robot could not operate.</p>
 <p>We did not have an off-the-shelf gear that matched our required dimensions or gear ratio, so I:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Reverse-engineered the existing gear geometry</li>
  <li>Resized and modified it in CAD to achieve the required speed-torque balance</li>
  <li>Adapted the hub and mounting features to match our shaft and bearing constraints</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Because the gear was printed, we could iterate quickly. Tooth geometry, wall thickness, and hub design were refined based on real load testing and wear. Print orientation and layer direction were chosen intentionally to handle torque and reduce shear failure.</p>
 <p>That process forced me to treat printed parts as real mechanical components with known limits, not placeholders. It also taught me when a printed part was acceptable for sustained use and when it should be treated as a consumable.</p>
 <p>This experience fundamentally shaped how I evaluate materials, loads, and failure modes.</p>

 <section class="section">
 <h2>Design for Serviceability</h2>
 <p>Competition conditions made serviceability non-negotiable.</p>
 <p>I prioritized:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Open, readable mechanical layouts</li>
  <li>Clear access to fasteners and wear components</li>
 <li>Mechanisms that could be inspected visually without disassembly</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Robots were intentionally left exposed during assembly and competition. This was not unfinished design - it was a deliberate choice to make faults visible and repairs fast.</p>
 <p>When something broke, the goal was not just to fix it, but to understand why it failed and adjust the design accordingly.</p>

 <section class="section">
 <h2>Modular Wiring and Electrical Clarity</h2>
 <p>Electrical reliability was treated as a first-order system requirement.</p>
 <p>I worked toward:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Modular wiring harnesses instead of point-to-point wiring</li>
  <li>Consistent routing and strain relief</li>
 <li>Clear labeling and separation of subsystems</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Subsystems could be disconnected and removed without disturbing the rest of the robot. This reduced repair time and prevented cascading failures.</p>
 <p>That mindset - designing wiring as a serviceable system rather than an afterthought - has carried forward into all my later work.</p>

 <h2>Practical Tradeoffs and Engineering Judgment</h2>
 <p>FIRST robotics taught me to balance theoretical performance against reliability and build reality.</p>
 <p>I made decisions such as:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Choosing simpler mechanisms when complex ones threatened schedule or reliability</li>
  <li>Designing for known failure and fast replacement instead of over-engineering</li>
 <li>Accepting material limitations and designing around them instead of ignoring them</li>
 </ul>
 <p>These tradeoffs were not academic. They directly affected match outcomes.</p>
 <p>That environment trained me to make engineering decisions under pressure, with incomplete information, and with real consequences - a skill that translates directly to professional engineering and manufacturing roles.</p>

 <h2>Why FIRST Still Matters in My Work</h2>
 <p>FIRST shaped how I think about systems more than any single later project.</p>
 <p>It taught me to:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Design for clarity, not cleverness</li>
  <li>Treat integration and maintenance as design problems</li>
  <li>Respect constraints as inputs, not obstacles</li>
  <li>Validate designs through real use, not assumptions</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The habits I developed there - modularity, serviceability, iteration, and honest assessment of failure - are the same habits I apply now, whether I am designing fixtures, cast parts, CNC modifications, or industrial interfaces.</p>
