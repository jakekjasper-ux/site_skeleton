 <p class="lead">
 The 2011 FIRST Robotics Competition game, Logo Motion, was a deceptively hard materials-handling problem:
 robots had to capture and place inflatable tubes (triangle, circle, square) onto scoring racks at multiple heights.
 In practice, the real enemy wasn't the rules it was how inconsistent flexible game pieces behave when you
 try to grab them at speed.
 </p>

 <div class="prose">
 <h3 style="margin-top:1.4rem;">What the mechanism was solving</h3>
 <p>
 Inflatable tubes are light, squishy, and unpredictable. A rigid roller can bounce them away. A perfect alignment
 assumption fails instantly on a real field. The approach here was to use multiple contact points and compliance 
 mechanisms that forgive imperfect alignment so the robot could reliably pull in, center, and retain the tube
 long enough to transfer it into the lift/manipulator.
 </p>

 <h3 style="margin-top:1.4rem;">My role</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>Contributed to mechanism design for tube capture and retention under misalignment and impacts.</li>
 <li>Designed and produced custom roller / intake components sized to COTS shafts, hubs, and mounting patterns.</li>
 <li>Iterated geometry and mounting based on match failures, driver feedback, and fast pit turnaround constraints.</li>
 <li>Supported integration with chain/belt systems and frame packaging constraints.</li>
 <li>Helped with repairs and tuning between matches where serviceability matters as much as performance.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3 style="margin-top:1.4rem;">Why this still matters</h3>
 <p>
 This project is early proof of the same habits that show up in my later field work: designing for unreliable inputs,
 tolerancing for human and environmental mess, and building systems that can be repaired fast when things inevitably
 break. The point wasn't building a robot it was learning to make a system behave in the real world.
 </p>

 <h3 style="margin-top:1.4rem;">Skills demonstrated</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Systems thinking under constraints:</strong> packaging, friction, compliance, failure modes.</li>
 <li><strong>Iterative prototyping:</strong> quick revisions based on observed performance, not guesses.</li>
 <li><strong>Integration:</strong> custom parts + COTS components + drivetrains + structure all needing to agree.</li>
 <li><strong>Serviceability:</strong> can we fix it in minutes becomes a design requirement.</li>
 </ul>
