 <div class="prose">
<p class="lead"><strong>Background:</strong> This project involved correcting a bathroom failure in a 1910s-era house where a recent remodel had been installed over a floor system that could not reliably support it. What appeared at first to be a fixture failure was ultimately a structural support problem.</p>

<h3>Existing Conditions and Failure Mechanism</h3>
<p>Selective demolition and investigation revealed a combination of issues beneath the finished surface. Over time, the house had undergone multiple flooring repairs and remodels, resulting in layered subfloor materials and localized patches rather than a continuous, uniform structural system. These conditions were further complicated by the behavior of an early-20th-century structure subject to significant seasonal movement. The remodeled bathroom floor lacked the stiffness required to support the combined weight of the tub, water, and user without compressing and transferring load into the fixture itself. Fiberglass tubs cannot tolerate differential support or repeated flexing. The cracking was not incidental, it was inevitable. Moisture intrusion followed the crack, penetrating the underlayment and quickset below, accelerating degradation.</p>

<h3>Structural Correction and Floor Rebuild</h3>
<p>Repairing the bathroom required addressing the structure first. The existing floor assembly was opened far enough to evaluate stiffness, continuity, and bearing. Inadequate and piecemeal repairs from prior remodels were removed, and the floor structure was reinforced and rebuilt to provide uniform support across the tub footprint. This work was necessary not only to prevent future cracking, but to stop load-induced compression that would damage any replacement fixture. No finish or fixture decisions were made until the floor system was made stable.</p>

<h3>Fixture Selection - Material Matters</h3>
<p>To prevent a repeat failure, the replacement tub was intentionally changed from fiberglass to a steel and porcelain unit. This was not an aesthetic upgrade. Steel and porcelain tubs distribute load differently and are far more tolerant of long-term use over older structures, even when minor seasonal movement is unavoidable. Combined with the reinforced floor system, this material choice ensured that normal use would not induce the flexing and cracking that destroyed the original tub.</p>

<h3>Rebuild and Restoration</h3>
<p>Once the structure and fixture support were corrected, the bathroom was rebuilt to match the existing layout with minimal collateral damage to surrounding finishes. Waterproofing and finish integration were performed only after structural behavior was corrected and verified. The goal was to return the bathroom to service without introducing new stresses or relying on finishes to compensate for structural deficiency.</p>
