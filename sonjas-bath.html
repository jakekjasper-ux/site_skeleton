 <div class="prose">
<p class="lead">This project involved a localized tub failure inside a recently remodeled bathroom, where surface finishes appeared intact but the underlying assembly had failed structurally.</p>

<p>The fiberglass tub flexed under normal use due to inadequate support. That movement led to cracking, which created a direct water path into the underlayment and apron framing. Because the surrounding finishes remained visually sound, the failure progressed quietly until investigation exposed the true condition.</p>

<p>The constraint was explicit: correct the failure path without dismantling the rest of the room.</p>

<h3>System context</h3>
<p>The bathroom had already been remodeled and was otherwise performing as intended. The failure was isolated to the tub assembly itself ? specifically the load path and waterproofing beneath the tub. This required treating the tub not as a fixture, but as a structural and moisture system embedded within an otherwise intact assembly.</p>

<h3>Observed failure</h3>
<p>Selective demolition revealed a simple, traceable sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inadequate bedding and voids beneath the fiberglass tub</li>
<li>Tub flex under normal loading</li>
<li>Crack formation at the tub base</li>
<li>Water migration into underlayment and apron framing</li>
<li>Localized degradation of substrate and support</li>
</ul>
<p>The failure was not cosmetic and not room-wide. It was a single broken load path with predictable consequences.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>The repair was handled as a targeted investigation followed by controlled reconstruction. Work proceeded in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selective demolition limited to the tub and apron to preserve surrounding finishes</li>
<li>Exposure and drying of affected substrate and framing</li>
<li>Rebuild of structural support and decking beneath the tub</li>
<li>Replacement with a rigid porcelain-coated steel tub to tolerate movement</li>
<li>Waterproofing and transition rebuild before tying back into existing tile</li>
</ul>
<p>At each stage, the guiding constraint was to restore structural and moisture integrity without expanding scope unnecessarily.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<ul>
<li>Restored a rigid, continuous load path beneath the tub</li>
<li>Eliminated flex that led to cracking and water intrusion</li>
<li>Rebuilt waterproof transitions without disturbing intact finishes</li>
<li>Final assembly reads as part of the original remodel, not a patch</li>
</ul>
