<h2>About</h2>
<p>
I work at the intersection of electrical systems, water infrastructure, construction, and hands-on engineering. My background stretches from 03A pump electrical service and deep-well systems to structural remodels, fabrication, and technical operations leadership. I approach projects as integrated systems—mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, human, and operational—and I specialize in bridging the gap between field constraints, design intent, and practical execution.
</p>
<p>
I hold a B.S. in Psychology from the University of Idaho with an emphasis in Industrial &amp; Organizational psychology, with formal training in behavioral-based safety and risk analysis. That background shapes how I evaluate systems that involve people, processes, and hazard exposure—particularly how work is actually performed versus how it is specified. It shows up in my attention to workflow, failure modes, communication breakdowns, and decision-making under pressure, especially in safety-critical environments.
</p>
<p>
Before moving into technical fieldwork, I led operational turnaround efforts at a multi-state agricultural manufacturing company, coordinating production, logistics, HR, and financial restructuring. That experience reinforced how organizational structure, incentives, and communication directly affect system performance and safety—lessons I now apply on every job site and technical engagement.
</p>
<p>
Earlier in life, I worked in FDA-regulated dairy processing as a licensed pasteurizer technician while still a teenager, ran milking systems, and handled quality control, refrigeration, and sanitation processes inside a regulated environment. I also spent four years in engineering-focused STEM programs (Project Lead The Way) and competed in FIRST Robotics, where I prototyped and fabricated mechanisms used in competition.
</p>
<p>
Across all disciplines, I'm drawn to projects where materials, physics, and human behavior intersect. Whether diagnosing a failing well system, rebuilding a bathroom envelope, designing a custom mechanical solution, or coordinating a complex multi-stakeholder scope, my work is driven by precision, practicality, and systems-level awareness.
