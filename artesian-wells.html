 <div class="prose">
  <p>The work shown here involves active artesian wells, serviced as part of potable water systems where flow exists before containment is complete and pressure management is continuous.</p>
  <p>Unlike conventional pumped wells, artesian systems do not wait for installation to be finished. Head pressure is present immediately, and the system will discharge until it is controlled. Errors at this stage lead to erosion, turbidity, damaged hardware, contaminated work areas, and unsafe electrical conditions.</p>
  <p>The work documented here reflects field methods used to control artesian head first, then stage containment and complete mechanical and electrical work without compromising water quality or future serviceability.</p>

 <h2>Managing Artesian Head</h2>
 <div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fit,minmax(280px,1fr));gap:1.25rem;align-items:start;">
  <div class="prose">
  <p>Artesian work begins by managing water level, not by attempting full isolation. Head management comes first; containment steps follow once pressure is controlled.</p>
   <p>The method used on these systems was to hang a submersible pump to actively draw down the water column and create a temporary working window. Mechanical and electrical work was performed while the well refilled under artesian pressure. As water approached grade, work paused, the pump was re-engaged, and the cycle repeated.</p>
   <p>This draw-down / refill approach allowed work to proceed in controlled stages. Each cycle reduced exposure and advanced containment rather than forcing rushed or uncontrolled work.</p>

 <h2>Containment and Pitless Installation</h2>
 <div class="prose">
  <p>Containment in artesian systems is incremental. Spool-style pitless assemblies were installed under live conditions, with alignment, sealing surfaces, and access verified during each draw-down cycle. Components were staged so that containment improved with each step, rather than relying on a single final action.</p>
  <p>Once backfilled, access is gone. Pitless alignment, electrical routing, and service clearance were confirmed before final placement. Mistakes at this stage cannot be corrected without excavation.</p>
  <p>Electrical and control work occurred alongside mechanical staging, often in wet conditions. Enclosures, penetrations, and routing were selected with the expectation that future service would occur under the same artesian constraints.</p>
 </div>
 </section>

 <section class="section">
 <h2>Utility and Environmentally Sensitive Sites</h2>
 <div class="prose">
  <p>Some of the systems shown supported utility and environmentally sensitive infrastructure, including work coordinated through Stevens County PUD and installations such as the Usk Fish Hatchery, where work was performed in coordination with tribal stakeholders and Seattle City Light.</p>
  <p>On these sites, artesian control was only one part of the problem. Sequencing also had to account for restored ground, downstream systems, environmental exposure, and the expectation that future maintenance would occur without disturbing finished site work.</p>
  <p>The same head-management and containment methods were used, but with tighter controls around access, verification, and final condition before close-out.</p>

 <h2>Water Quality and Return to Service</h2>
 <div class="prose">
  <p>All work occurred within DOH-regulated public water systems and was coordinated with operators of record.</p>
  <p>Following mechanical or electrical intervention, chlorination, flushing, and sample collection were performed before systems were returned to normal operation. Because artesian systems recharge continuously, verification focused on observed behavior — pressure response, flow stability, and absence of turbidity — rather than assumptions based on installation alone.</p>
 </div>

 <section class="section">
 <h3>Closing</h3>
 <p>Artesian wells require discipline. Pressure management, containment sequencing, and service access must be addressed before convenience or speed. The work shown here reflects methods used to control active systems safely, complete installations under live conditions, and leave infrastructure that can be serviced without excavation or improvisation.</p>
