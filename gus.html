 <h3>Context</h3>
 <p>
 The bathroom sits beneath a dormer addition in an older home. That dormer was poorly constructed and relied on a covered-over window frame for vertical support a member never intended to carry load. At the same time, plumbing installation had compromised the floor system directly below.
 </p>
 <p>
 Selective demolition exposed two failures working together: the dormer framing depended on the window opening with no proper load transfer to framing below, and three floor joists in the center of the bathroom had been cut completely through and left unsupported for plumbing. The result was extreme floor deflection, uneven transitions, and finish cracking that could not be corrected without structural intervention.
 </p>
 <p>
 This was not a finish problem. It was a load-path failure compounded by compromised framing and poor sequencing.
 </p>

 <h3>Observed failures</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>Dormer structure bearing on a window frame not designed for load</li>
 <li>Multiple floor joists cut and unsupported to accommodate plumbing</li>
 <li>Severe floor slope and deflection at the center of the room</li>
 <li>Sagging floor and protruding drains telegraphing structural movement</li>
 <li>Plumbing penetrations routed without regard for structural continuity</li>
 <li>Moisture risk in an attic assembly due to lack of a continuous waterproof strategy</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Approach</h3>
 <p>
 The project was handled as an investigation first, rebuild second. The goal was to restore a valid structural load path before addressing finishes.
 </p>
 <p>
 Sequence: expose -> understand -> stabilize -> rebuild -> waterproof -> finish. No finish work occurred until the dormer framing and floor system were structurally corrected and verified.
 </p>

 <h3>Scope of work</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>Selective demolition to expose dormer framing, window structure, floor joists, and plumbing interactions</li>
 <li>Structural correction of dormer framing to remove reliance on the window frame as a load-bearing element</li>
 <li>Repair and reinforcement of cut floor joists to restore continuous support</li>
 <li>Subfloor correction to eliminate deflection and slope</li>
<li>Plumbing reconfiguration coordinated with restored structural members</li>
<li>Rebuild of bathroom envelope with appropriate substrate and waterproofing</li>
<li>Finish installation only after structural stability was confirmed</li>
</ul>

 <h3>Outcome</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>Restored load path from dormer framing to floor structure</li>
 <li>Level, stable floor that no longer telegraphs movement into tile and grout</li>
 <li>Plumbing routed without compromising structural members</li>
 <li>Waterproof envelope designed around real penetrations and roof geometry</li>
 <li>Finishes that remain intact because the structure beneath them is sound</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Skills demonstrated</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>Structural failure diagnosis in older construction</li>
 <li>Load-path correction in improperly framed dormer assemblies</li>
 <li>Floor joist repair and subfloor stabilization</li>
 <li>Plumbing and structure coordination under constraint</li>
 <li>Waterproofing strategy in high-risk, sloped-roof assemblies</li>
 <li>Finish execution that follows structure instead of hiding failure</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>This project reflects a systems-first approach: when finishes fail, decide whether they are symptoms or signals. Here they were signals, and correcting the structure was the only durable solution.</p>
