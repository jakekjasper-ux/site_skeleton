<main><section class="section"><h1 class="page-title">3D Printing, Robotics &amp; Prototyping</h1><p class="page-lede">I use 3D printing as a CAD-driven engineering tool, not a fabrication shortcut. Every part shown here begins as a modeled system â€” geometry, constraints, interfaces, and assembly relationships resolved in CAD before anything is printed.</p><div class="prose">
<p>Across this work, printing is a downstream step. The real work happens earlier: defining interfaces, controlling alignment, and deciding what matters dimensionally before committing time or material to final fabrication.</p>
<p>My background is hands-on and systems-heavy: PLTW engineering through high school, architecture and engineering coursework with Revit exposure, and FIRST Robotics, where a small core group integrated mechanical and electrical systems under real deadlines. The common thread is design under constraint, executed through CAD-first thinking and validated in the physical world.</p>
</div></section>
<section class="section"><h2>CAD-Driven Functional Repairs &amp; Precision Fit Parts</h2><p class="section-subtitle">These examples focus on reverse-engineered, fit-verified components, where tolerance, alignment, and interface fidelity matter more than visual novelty.</p>
<div class="prose">
<p>These examples focus on reverse-engineered, fit-verified components, where tolerance, alignment, and daily use matter more than appearance.</p>
<p>Iteration happens in Fusion 360 or Inventor â€” adjusting geometry, offsets, and clearances â€” before printing and test-fitting.</p>

<section class="section"><h2>CNC, Sensors &amp; Mechatronic Interfaces</h2><p class="section-subtitle">Printed brackets and interfaces that make commodity sensors usable on real machines.</p>
<div class="prose">
<p>Reliable sensor integration is almost always a mechanical problem, not an electrical one. Positioning, adjustability, and repeatability under vibration matter more than the sensor itself.</p>
<p>The CNC limit switch mounts shown here were modeled as parametric CAD parts, designed to allow fine adjustment while maintaining repeatable homing behavior. Assemblies were modeled to verify travel limits, fastener access, and service clearance before printing.</p>
<p>Printing here is used to validate interface geometry quickly. Once behavior is confirmed, the same CAD models can be adapted for other materials or mounting conditions.</p>

<section class="section"><h2>Exploratory Mechanisms &amp; Propulsion Prototypes</h2><p class="section-subtitle">Concept-driven prototypes built to test performance vs. weight, geometry, and assembly constraints.</p>
<div class="prose">
<p>Some projects exist specifically to explore performance versus geometry, weight, and assembly logic, rather than to produce a finished artifact.</p>
<p>The propulsion mount shown here began as a reverse-engineered CAD model derived from a consumer drone motor and rotor assembly. From there, the geometry was mirrored and reworked into a self-locating, clip-together structure that centers itself on the rotor axis.</p>
<p>The work followed a deliberate loop: model â†’ print â†’ test â†’ revise. When external constraints paused the project, the CAD remained complete and reusable. That is normal engineering life â€” sometimes the experiment stops because the world changes, not because the model is wrong.</p>

<section class="section"><h2>Industrial &amp; Process-Equipment Prototyping</h2><p class="section-subtitle">Adapters and fit-up tooling to align and support mixed-material assemblies in real equipment.</p>
<div class="prose">
<p>For process equipment, the difficult part is often the interface: aligning new components to existing stainless hardware while preserving serviceability.</p>
<p>The agitator/pasteurizer adapters shown here were designed entirely in CAD as structural fit-up tooling. Assemblies were modeled to control shaft alignment and mounting geometry during testing. Printing allowed rapid iteration until the system ran correctly.</p>
<p>Plastic was never treated as a permanent material here. The CAD and printed parts existed to prove geometry and alignment before committing to final fabrication.</p>

<section class="section"><h2>Manufacturing Tooling &amp; Casting Workflow</h2><p class="section-subtitle">Reusable tooling designed around the realities of packing, disassembly, preheat, and pour.</p>
<div class="prose">
<p>This work focused on CAD-designed tooling systems, not one-off accessories.</p>
<p>The modular sand mold box system was designed as a parametric assembly, using grooved planks and printed ABS clips to allow packing, ramming, and non-destructive disassembly. CAD modeling allowed separation of the packing stage from the preheat and pour stages â€” a workflow decision made before any material was printed.</p>
<p>The value was not the print. It was the repeatable, reversible process designed into the tooling.</p>

<section class="section"><h2>FIRST Robotics Foundation</h2><p class="section-subtitle">Early systems integration under competition constraints design, fabrication, troubleshooting, and making the whole machine work.</p>
<div class="prose">
<p>FIRST Robotics is where CAD-driven iteration under time pressure became normal.</p>
<p>I was part of the small core group responsible for integrating the full robot. My initial scope included CAD-designed drivetrain components (ABS gears and sprockets) and tracked drivetrain subframes, but in practice the work extended across design, fabrication, troubleshooting, and integration.</p>
<p>Models had to work not just individually, but as assemblies â€” because that is what competition deadlines enforce.</p>

<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>Across all of this work, the pattern is consistent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systems modeled before being built</li>
<li>Interfaces resolved in CAD, not guessed in the field</li>
<li>Prototypes printed to validate geometry and behavior</li>
<li>Final materials chosen only after the model proves out</li>
</ul>
