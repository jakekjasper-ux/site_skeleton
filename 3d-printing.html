<main><section class="section"><h1 class="page-title">3D Printing - Prototyping, Components &amp; Robotics</h1><p class="page-lede">I use 3D printing as a CAD-driven engineering tool, not a fabrication shortcut. Every part shown here begins as a modeled system - geometry, constraints, interfaces, and assembly relationships resolved in CAD before anything is printed.</p><div class="prose">
<p>Across this work, printing is a downstream step. The real work happens earlier: defining interfaces, controlling alignment, and deciding what matters dimensionally before committing time or material to final fabrication.</p>
<p>My background is hands-on and systems-heavy: PLTW engineering through high school, architecture and engineering coursework with Revit exposure, and FIRST Robotics, where a small core group integrated mechanical and electrical systems under real deadlines. The common thread is design under constraint, executed through CAD-first thinking and validated in the physical world.</p>
</div></section>
<section class="section"><h2>FIRST Robotics - 3D Printing for Functional Drivetrain Components</h2><p class="section-subtitle">Early systems integration under competition constraints - full robot story on <a class="chip" href="first-robotics.html">FIRST Robotics</a>.</p>
<p class="lead">My earliest experience using 3D printing for mission-critical parts came from FIRST Robotics, where we relied on printed components not just for brackets or guards, but for active drivetrain elements.</p>
<div class="prose">
<p>One of the most important printed parts I worked on was a conveyor / track drive gear used to power the robot's tracked intake system. The gear directly transmitted motor torque to the tracks; if it failed, the robot could not operate.</p>
<p>We did not have an off-the-shelf gear that matched the required pitch, width, and ratio, so I reverse-engineered the original gear geometry, resized it in CAD to achieve the needed gear ratio for our motor and reduction setup, and adapted it to fit our shaft and bearing constraints.</p>
<p>Because the part was printed, design changes could be made quickly:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Gear diameter and tooth count were adjusted to tune speed vs. torque</li>
 <li>Hub geometry was modified for proper shaft engagement</li>
 <li>Wall thickness and tooth profile were refined based on wear and failure observations</li>
</ul>
<p>These gears were printed, installed, tested under load, and iterated until they reliably drove the tracks through matches. That process forced me to treat printed parts as real mechanical components, not placeholders.</p>
<p>While we printed many other parts - sensor mounts, wire management, spacers, and guards - the drivetrain gear set the standard. It taught me to:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Respect print orientation and layer direction under torque</li>
 <li>Design around predictable failure modes rather than pretending plastic behaves like metal</li>
 <li>Decide when a printed part was acceptable for continued use versus when it should be treated as a consumable</li>
</ul>
<p>That experience shaped how I use 3D printing today. When I choose to print a functional part, it's because I understand the loads, the risks, and the tradeoffs - and because the part can be designed, tested, and replaced faster than a machined alternative.</p>

<section class="section"><h2>Drone Motor Mount - Mirrored Assembly and Thrust Exploration</h2><p class="section-subtitle">Mirrored dual-motor mount built to explore thrust-to-weight behavior using commodity components.</p>
<div class="prose">
<p>The drone motor mount project was developed as an early-stage experimental platform to investigate thrust-to-weight behavior using inexpensive, readily available electric flight components.</p>
<p>A consumer-grade drone motor, gearbox, propeller, and mounting hardware were selected as a baseline to keep assumptions explicit and costs low. Rather than optimizing a single propulsion unit, the focus was on configuration-level behavior: how thrust output, mass, and packaging interact when propulsion elements are stacked within a constrained volume.</p>
<p>To support this, I designed a mirrored motor mount assembly that allowed two motors and propellers to be arranged in a dual-stack configuration within a compact footprint. The mirrored geometry minimized asymmetric loading and enabled controlled comparison between single- and dual-stack arrangements while reusing common parts.</p>
<p>The objective was not performance optimization, but feasibility assessment: determining whether a mirrored, stacked configuration could produce a meaningful increase in thrust relative to added mass and footprint. This question is directly relevant to conceptual electric vertical flight and lift-assisted propulsion systems, where packaging efficiency and thrust density often dominate early design tradeoffs.</p>
<p>3D-printed prototypes were used to validate alignment, shaft concentricity, propeller clearance, and assembly feasibility before committing to more refined materials or instrumentation. Printing enabled rapid iteration of mounting geometry and spacing while exposing mechanical constraints such as vibration sensitivity, tolerance stack-up, and access limitations.</p>
<p>This work functioned as a physical exploration of system-level tradeoffs, providing concrete feedback on configuration viability rather than relying solely on theoretical scaling assumptions.</p>

<section class="section"><h2>Dual-Orientation Limit Switch Mounts (CNC)</h2><p class="section-subtitle">Printed brackets and interfaces that make commodity sensors usable on real machines.</p>
<div class="prose">
<p>I designed a modular, two-part limit switch mount for a Woodpecker-based desktop CNC.</p>

<p>The challenge was not wiring the switches; it was positioning them accurately, repeatably, and robustly on a machine that was never designed to accept them. I designed a two-part, dual-orientation bracket system that allows the same printed components to be mounted in different locations and orientations across the machine. I also added a homing sequence to the Woodpecker control code to take advantage of the new end-stop positions.</p>

<p>This project reflects my view that sensor integration is primarily a mechanical challenge. The electrical interface is trivial; reliability comes from proper positioning, rigidity, and adjustability.</p>

<h2>Precision Repair Example - Ray-Ban Folding Sunglasses</h2>
<p class="section-subtitle">Reverse-engineered, fit-verified replacement for a folding bridge.</p>

<div class="prose">
<p>I reverse-engineered and replaced the broken bridge on a pair of folding Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses.</p>

<p>The part required precise hinge alignment and correct folding geometry. I measured the original components, modeled the bridge in CAD, printed the part in a suitable polymer, and iterated until folding motion and fit matched the original.</p>

<p>The finished part restored full daily-use functionality. This project is representative of how I handle precision reverse-engineering and functional replacement, where small tolerance errors are not forgiving.</p>

<section class="section"><h2>Industrial Equipment Interface Prototype - Dairy Agitator</h2><p class="section-subtitle">Non-invasive, clamp-based adapter for stainless process equipment.</p>

<div class="prose">
<p>I designed and implemented a non-invasive prototype interface for stainless industrial (creamery) process equipment operating in an active production environment.</p>

<p>The objective was to introduce new functionality without permanent modification to existing assets. This required avoiding drilling, welding, or alterations that would compromise serviceability, sanitation, or future maintenance. To achieve this, I modeled the as-installed geometry of the equipment, identified structurally and operationally appropriate attachment zones, and designed clamp-based mounting solutions that respected existing load paths and access constraints.</p>

<p>Printed components were used selectively for alignment, positioning, and interface control, while metal hardware carried structural loads where required. This hybrid approach allowed rapid iteration during development while maintaining robustness appropriate for industrial use.</p>

<p>The resulting interface is fully reversible and serviceable, preserving cleaning access, inspection clearance, and maintenance workflows. The design reflects the same constraints present in regulated production environments, where modifications must integrate cleanly into existing systems without introducing operational, compliance, or lifecycle risk.</p>

<section class="section"><h2>Pattern-Making &amp; Modular Tooling (Sand Casting)</h2><p class="section-subtitle">Reusable tooling designed around packing, disassembly, preheat, and pour. <a class="chip" href="fabrication.html">See fabrication build</a></p>
<div class="prose">
<p>The sand-casting flask shown here was intentionally designed as a reusable, modular tooling system, not a disposable mold box.</p>

<p>Rather than using a single-use wooden frame, I designed a cope-and-drag flask with finger-jointed wooden sides and 3D-printed ABS alignment hardware that locks the two halves together in a fixed orientation. The printed clips act as alignment guides and retainers, ensuring the mold halves re-register precisely on every assembly. Alignment and repeatability were solved in CAD before anything was cut or printed.</p>

<p>The flask design incorporates proper draft angles on all vertical surfaces so patterns can be withdrawn cleanly without tearing the sand. Pull direction, clearance, and demolding were resolved upfront. The flask can be disassembled non-destructively after the pour, allowing repeated use without degrading alignment or surface fidelity.</p>

<p>This approach mirrors matchplate and foundry tooling principles: solve registration, draft, and repeatability in the tooling — not during the pour.</p>

<p>I also designed printed runners and sprue features to control metal flow and venting. Gating was treated as part of the system, not an afterthought. Air evacuation, fill order, and pour stability were considered alongside mold geometry.</p>

<p>I controlled feedstock quality and melt behavior deliberately. I cast small ingots to verify alloy behavior before committing to finished parts, and I managed crucible handling and pour sequencing to keep the workflow safe and repeatable. The mold preparation and pouring stages were decoupled to reduce time pressure and improve consistency.</p>

<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>Across all of this work, the pattern is consistent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systems modeled before being built</li>
<li>Interfaces resolved in CAD, not guessed in the field</li>
<li>Prototypes printed to validate geometry and behavior</li>
<li>Final materials chosen only after the model proves out</li>
