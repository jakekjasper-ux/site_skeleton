<p>
 Chattaroy Cheese Co. was our <strong>family-owned goat dairy</strong> and creamery that my mother opened for business during my high school senior year. Shortly after kids popped, production started there, and the work was <strong>operational from day one</strong>: sanitation, workflow, equipment use, and system reliability under daily demand.
</p>

<div class="prose" style="margin-top:1.25rem;">
<p>This was not build-out or planning work. It was learning how a <strong>regulated food-production system</strong> behaves once it is running.</p>

<p>The farm's well system was regulated as a <strong>public water system</strong> associated with commercial food production. Water quality, reliability, and disinfection were not background utilities; they were part of the compliance envelope the creamery operated inside. Water touched everything: sanitation, equipment cleaning, pasteurization, product safety, and regulatory exposure.</p>

<p>Production centered on <strong>batch pasteurization</strong> and cheese-making workflows, using a glycol-based pasteurization system. At the time, only my mother and I were authorized operators for that system. I was the <strong>youngest Licensed Dairy Pasteurizer Technician</strong> in Washington State, authorized by the Department of Health.</p>

<p>That authorization carried real responsibility. Pasteurization required correct <strong>temperature control</strong>, <strong>timing</strong>, <strong>verification</strong>, and repeatable <strong>sanitation</strong> between batches. The system had to be operated correctly, cleaned correctly, and documented consistently to keep production compliant and moving.</p>

<p>Production also began outside the building. The creamery was supported by a herd of roughly sixty goats, including milking does that were the literal source of the product. Managing livestock health, barn conditions, and milking created a constant boundary between barnyard conditions and food-grade space. Moving animals to milk - and bringing the barnyard back with them - made that <strong>clean/dirty boundary</strong> continuous and unavoidable.</p>

<p>Daily work involved <strong>sanitation discipline</strong>, <strong>clean-to-dirty transitions</strong>, <strong>stainless process equipment handling</strong>, washdown procedures, batch timing, material handling, and throughput pressure. Hose routing, drain behavior, access paths, and water availability either supported safe production or became immediate failure points.</p>

<p>I grew up in livestock environments through a lifelong 4-H background, and that context mattered. Animals introduce variability, waste, and contamination risk. Systems that succeed do not ignore that; they manage it through separation, process control, and consistent <strong>sanitation practice</strong>.</p>

<p>That experience established an early operational bias that carries through later work: systems that appear correct at install often fail under daily use. When animals, regulated water, pasteurization, sanitation, and production intersect, operational reality shows up fast.</p>
